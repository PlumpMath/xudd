XUDD is an asynchronous actor model system with several aims:

 - Easy to write asynchronous code.  Uses coroutines to make async
   code clear and easy to read.
 - Actors make writing clean, modular code easy.  Resource allocation
   without locking by deferring resource controls to various actors.
 - Future goals of easy task load balancing, spreading tasks across
   multiple processes and machines easily.

This is all fairly ambitious stuff.  If you're interested in helping,

   understand what this has to do with chaotic deities, or why it's
   called XUDD."
